Fitting
*******

Jupyter notebooks with fitting examples can be found `here
<https://github.com/Q3D/q3dfit/tree/main/jnb>`_. You can download and
run these examples on your own computer, either directly or by cloning
the ``q3dfit`` repository. Or, you can test the notebooks in binder:

Released notebooks
==================

In the present release, four example notebooks are available.
	  
1. **Ground-based data, rest-frame optical, single emission-line
   component, quasar**

   Data cube is from Gemini/GMOS observations of `PG1411+442 <https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/byname?objname=PG1411%2B442&hconst=67.8&omegam=0.308&omegav=0.692&wmap=4&corr_z=1>`_, as published in `Rupke et al. 2017 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850...40R/abstract>`_.
