q3dfit
======

``q3dfit`` is custom software for scientific analysis of integral
field unit (IFU) spectroscopy of quasars and their host galaxies,
specifically aimed at producing science-ready measurements from James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) IFU spectrographs. ``q3dfit`` takes advantage
of the spectral differences between quasars and their host galaxies
for maximal-contrast subtraction of the quasar point-spread function
(PSF) to reveal and characterize the faint extended emission of the
host galaxy. Host galaxy emission is carefully fit with a combination
of stellar continuum, emission and absorption of dust and ices, and
ionic and molecular emission lines.

``q3dfit`` has been tested on ground-based data where PSF is weakly
wavelength-dependent. The update of ``q3dfit`` to the case of the strongly
wavelength-dependent JWST PSF is currently in development.
