If components are removed, the fit is re-run. The `sigcut` parameter determines the level of the significance cut. The `perror_useresid` option allows to substitute the formal line flux error with one estimated from the residual of the continnuum fit. This aids in more accurate component rejection in this case, because undersampling wiggles and fringeing are still present in the data and raise the actual error above that estimated by the pipeline (which is in any case too small).
